# NextJS ➕ MUI X (DatePickers) + TailwindCSS Starter

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

It includes ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript support out of the box. It includes appropriate [VS Code settings](./.vscode/settings.json) to ensure a consistent development experience.

It includes a pre-commit 🪝 using `husky` and `lint-staged` (see `package.json`).

It includes [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) with [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) support for form validation.

It includes [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/).

## Testing ✅

- Vitest + React Testing Library with Linting

## Getting Started

First, run the development server: `npm run dev`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
